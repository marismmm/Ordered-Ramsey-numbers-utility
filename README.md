# Ordered-Ramsey-numbers-utility
A small Python GUI utility used to find avoiding colorings for a special Ramsey type problem by utilizing a SAT solver.

## Installation and usage

See the user guide .pdf included :)

## Contributing
This is by all means not a perfect application - any bugfixes and pull requests are welcome.

## Acknowledgements
Among other Python libraries I use, I decided to include two of them - [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/)
and [satispy](https://pypi.org/project/satispy/) in this repository. All credit goes to the authors of these libraries. The former is included because I've made some very minor changes in orderto visualize ordered graphs. The utility will not work correctly without them. The latter is included (and unchanged) for convenience as I found it to be a rather uncommon library.
